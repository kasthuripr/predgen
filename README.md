# Sales Strategy Evaluation Pipeline

This project evaluates the **quality of sales strategies** generated by a model grounded in SHAP-based risk factors versus a plain generative prompt using only opportunity context. The goal is to quantify and visualize how much better strategies become when grounded in predictive insights.

## What It Does

- Trains a predictive model on sales opportunities.
- Generates strategies using two approaches:
  1. **Predictively Enhanced Prompt** — includes SHAP values, 75th percentiles, and model risk factors.
  2. **Opportunity Only Prompt** — uses only raw opportunity context.
- Evaluates each strategy's quality based on:
  - Specificity
  - Grounding
  - Actionability
  - Relevance
  - Clarity
- Plots the average quality score comparison in a bar chart.


## How to Run

1. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

	python -m venv .venv

	source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate


2. **Install dependencies**

	pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the code**

	python pipeline.py

	This will:

	- Train the predictive model

	- Generate 50 opportunities with both prompt types

	- Evaluate each strategy’s quality

	- Print average quality scores

	- Show a comparison plot
